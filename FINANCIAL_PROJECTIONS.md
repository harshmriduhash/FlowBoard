## 💼 Unit Economics

### Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Assumptions:**
- Average customer lifetime: 18 months (conservative)
- Churn rate: 5% monthly
- Mix: 70% Pro, 30% Team

**Average Revenue Per User (ARPU):**
- (0.7 × $29) + (0.3 × $99) = $50/month

**LTV Calculation:**
- $50/month × 18 months = **$900 LTV**

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**With Organic/Content Marketing:**
- Cost per customer: ~$5-15 (mainly time + tools)
- **CAC: $10**

**LTV:CAC Ratio:**
- $900 / $10 = **90:1** (Excellent! Target is 3:1)

**Payback Period:**
- $10 CAC / $50 monthly = **0.2 months** (6 days!)
