- **Ask:** Bootstrapping to $10K MRR, then evaluating funding options

### Key Metrics (12-Month Target)
- **Users:** 1,600 total, 200+ paying
- **MRR:** $9,095
- **ARR Run Rate:** $109,140

- **LTV:** $900
- **LTV:CAC:** 90:1

## 🎯 Problem

### The Core Problem

**Workflow management today is broken:**

1. **Manual Overload**
   - Teams spend 10-20 hours/week updating boards manually
   - Status checks require constant human intervention
   - No proactive alerts when things go wrong

2. **Visibility Gap**
   - Hidden blockers until it's too late
   - Managers ask "what's the status?" repeatedly
   - Work gets stuck with no visibility

3. **Static Tools**
   - Trello/Asana/Monday are digital spreadsheets
   - No intelligence, just data storage
   - User has to DO everything

4. **No Natural Interface**
   - Always typing, clicking, navigating
   - Not accessible when hands-free needed
   - Slow to get answers

### Who Feels This Pain?

**Primary:**
- Project Managers managing 5-20 people
- Engineering leads coordinating technical work
- Operations teams running processes
- Startup founders wearing many hats

**Secondary:**
- Freelancers managing client work
- Consultants tracking deliverables
- Small agencies (5-20 people)

### Current Alternatives (And Why They Fail)

| Tool | Weakness |
|------|----------|
| Trello | No AI, manual only, no workflow validation |
| Asana | Complex, expensive, still manual |
| Monday.com | Expensive, overwhelming UI |
| Notion | Not workflow-focused, no agents |
| Linear | Eng-only, no AI assistance |

**Gap:** None have AI agents or voice interface.
